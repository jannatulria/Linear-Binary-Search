# Search Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of two basic searching algorithms in C++:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## 1) Linear Search
### Description
Linear Search checks each element one by one until the target element is found or the array ends.

### Key Points
- Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays
- Simple and easy to implement

### Time Complexity
- Best: O(1)
- Average: O(n)
- Worst: O(n)

## 2) Binary Search
### Description
Binary Search works only on a **sorted array**. It repeatedly divides the search range into halves.

### Key Points
- Array must be sorted
- Faster for large datasets than linear search

### Time Complexity
- Best: O(1)
- Average: O(log n)
- Worst: O(log n)
